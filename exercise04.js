// 4.  Write a small program that has a line of code that does each
// of the following and prints out the result:

// Add two numbers together.
// EG: eight plus fifteen
console.log (8 + 15)


// Add three numbers together using the addition operator.
// EG: eight plus fifteen plus negative one hundred
console.log (8 + 15 + -23)
// Add a positive and a negative number.
// EG: negative five plus thirty two point eight
console.log (-10 + 5)
// Subtract two numbers.
// EG: thirty five minus two point eight
console.log(10 - 2)
// Subtract three numbers.
// EG: thirty five minus two point eight minus seventeen
console.log (35 - 5 - 79)

// Subtract a positive and a negative number.
// EG: negative five plus thirty two minus eight
console.log (7 - 15 - - 32)
// Combine the addition and subtraction operators with three numbers.
// EG: seventy five plus negative thirty five minus two point eight
console.log (75 + -35 - 2.8)

// Multiply two numbers
// EG: six times negative zero point one
console.log (15 * -3.5)
// Multiply three numbers where one is negative
// EG: negative eight times five times one billion point eight
console.log (-5 * 5 * 5)

// Divide two numbers
// EG: five divided by negative twelve.
console.log (5/3)
// Divide three numbers
// EG: twenty five divided by negative twelve divided by two
console.log (27 / 9 / 3)
// Find the remainder of dividing two integers
// EG: The remainder left when dividing twenty five by four
console.log (7 % 3)

// An expression that uses each of the following:
// Negative and Positive Numbers, Integers and Doubles, Parenthesis,
// Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulo.
// EG: The remainder of five plus negative four minus negative
// four times three divided by two point three, divided by nine
console.log ((7- -3)^2 * 52) + 25 % (45 / 9)
