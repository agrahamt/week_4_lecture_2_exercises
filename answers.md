1.  Select the string expressions from the listed options.

    a. "Hello World"
    b. "Your number is " + someNumber
    c. "Hello" + "World"

2.  Select all the falsey values from the following options:

    a. false
    b. 0
    c. ""
    e. null

3.  Define the term "strict equality".
Strict equality is determined in Javascript by comparing values using the "===" operator.  === only considers things to be equal if the types of the two values is the same , it does not convert those types before evaluating (unlike ==).  So, 433 and "433" are not strictly equal, 433 !== "433" (yes, I actually wrote this, though it probably looks like I copied it!)

4.  What does ((42 - 8) + 24 / 6 - 3 * 0) * (34 + (7 + (4 + 3) % 3) / 2) evaluate to? Please evaluate this by hand.

    a. 1444

5.  Which of the following operators do I use to invert a logical expression?

    c. !
